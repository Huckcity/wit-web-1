# WIT Semester 1
## Web Dev Assigment 1

This site is an example of a simple static website, built using EJS and compiled for deployment using Harp.

For deployment purposes, clone to your desired location, open command prompt and execute 
`harp compile`. This will generate a ./www folder which can then be deployed to any static hosting service.

Site can be viewed live [here](http://ag-wit-web-1.surge.sh/)
